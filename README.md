  - *Selected upates will include All updates, Sign up Bonus updates, Card basic information updates, Card Reward upates, card bonus / bonus credit updates, etc...
### Wallet 
- The Primary purpose of the wallet is for reccomendations and reccomending to users.
- This means, If many users have cards A, B, and C in their wallet, and you have cards A and B, the website will reccomend that others users with your wallet also have card C.
- This will be helpful for users looking to apply to new cards.
### Tracking
- Tracking is simply to store cards you feel interested in, for whatever reason the user deems worthy. If you simply want to recieve udpates, if you are waiting for a sign up bonus to increase, if you are thinking of applying to some cards, or if you want to make a mock-wallet, are all good reasons to track cards.
- As of now, it has not been determined whether or not is is useful to reccomend cards to users based off cards they are tracking.
